The Azure Key Vault to Kubernetes (akv2k8s) project makes 
Azure Key Vault objects available to Kubernetes in a simple and
secure way.

The goals for this project was:

1. Avoid a direct program dependency on Azure Key Vault for getting secrets, and adhere to the 12 Factor App principle for configuration (https://12factor.net/config)
2. Make it simple, secure and low risk to transfer Azure Key Vault secrets into Kubernetes as native Kubernetes secrets
3. Securely and transparently be able to inject Azure Key Vault secrets as environment variables to applications, without having to use native Kubernetes secrets

All of these goals are met.
